# DCI sample

Repository for [DCI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data,_Context,_and_Interaction) ports of the [DDD sample application](http://dddsample.sourceforge.net/). Contributors can upload their implementations (full or partial) here and discussions naturally takes place in:

* [object-composition](http://groups.google.com/group/object-composition/topics?hl=en) - Tutorial discussions on DCI.
* [dci-evolution](http://groups.google.com/group/dci-evolution/topics?hl=en) - Forum for people to discuss, clarify, and evolve the paradigm (all can read - members can write).

Code is organized by language -> contributor:

* **java**
   * [Ant Kutschera](https://github.com/DCI/dci-sample/tree/master/java/ant-kutschera) (empty for now...)
* **java-qi4j**
   * [Marc Grue](https://github.com/DCI/dci-sample/tree/master/java-qi4j/marc-grue) (full implementation)

If you want to share your DCI implementation of the DDD sample application or parts of it you send a message to marcgrue to get added as a contributor (write what programming language(s) you plan to use, then I can set you up).
