# DCI sample

Repository for [DCI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data,_Context,_and_Interaction) ports of the [DDD sample application](http://dddsample.sourceforge.net/). Contributors can upload their full or partial implementations here.

Code is organized by language -> contributor:

* **java-qi4j**
   * [Marc Grue](https://github.com/DCI/dci-sample/tree/master/java-qi4j/marc-grue)

If you want to share your DCI implementation of the DDD sample application or parts of it you send a message to marcgrue to get added as a contributor (write what programming language(s) you plan to use, then I can set you up).
